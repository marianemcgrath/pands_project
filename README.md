# **Overview**
The Iris Dataset, introduced by the British statistician Ronald Fisher in 1936, is a fundamental resource in statistics and machine learning. 
Comprising measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width from 150 iris flowersâ€”50 each from three distinct species: Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica.

Fisher used this dataset to illustrate linear discriminant analysis (LDA), a method for classifying data based on various input features. The clear distinctions among the classes in the Iris Dataset make it suitable for demonstrating how simple statistical models can be used to classify data effectively.

The Iris Dataset continues to be used for educational purposes in machine learning, benchmarking algorithms, and visualising analytical techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) and clustering. Its clear and versatile nature establishes it as a key resource in data science education.
